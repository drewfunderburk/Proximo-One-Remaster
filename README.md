# Proximo One Remaster
> Note: [Proximo One](https://github.com/drewfunderburk/Proximo-One) was a Unity project we created in our first year of GameDev school, and it represents our fastest work rather than our best work. This remaster is meant to illustrate more of the latter, and is far more indicative of what we are actually capable of in a short time frame. None of the original code is used, and all systems have been redesigned from the ground up to meet a higher standard. <br/><br/> This project is very much under construction at the moment.

### Original Description
Inspired heavily by the arcade games Galaga and 1942, Proximo One is a fast-paced, hectic top-down shooter with scaling difficulty and permadeath. Fight through waves of enemies while your warp drive charges, choosing when itâ€™s finished to either channel that energy into your shields for a big heal, or warp to the next planet as you are. Redoing the current planet will see the enemies increase slightly in difficulty, but otherwise give you a chance to catch their breath while moving on will increase the difficulty, but also the rewards. Survive and kill as many enemies as possible before your shields run out to claim the highest score!

#### Controls:
- WASD to move
- Esc to pause
